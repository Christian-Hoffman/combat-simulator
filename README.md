## Description
[Combat Simulator](https://christian-hoffman.github.io/combat-simulator/) \
Combat simulator is a turn based game where the player and enemy ai take turns using either their sword, staff, or shield. The player also has 2 health and 2 mana potions. You will choose between 3 tiers of each weapon, no tier can be picked more than once. Each round you will be fighting against a randomly generated ai that has a higher health and mana pool than you. Every time you defeat an enemy a new one will take their place until you have been defeated. After you are defeated you will find yourself at your death screen. A peaceful quote will allow you to reflect after your journey. You fought hard and well, good luck on your next journey.
